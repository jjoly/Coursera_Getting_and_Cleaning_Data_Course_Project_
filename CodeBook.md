# Project description



The R script (run_analysis.R) reads in the experimental data (described below) and performs a series of transformations to create a summarized data set called **tidy.txt**.


# Original Data Set Information:
The Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

# Analysis steps

The R script reads in the files contained in the getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip data set and performs a number of steps:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurements.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Creates a new tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Description of output variables

The first two columns in the output file _tidy.txt_ are:
1. **Subject** This id of the experimental participant (1-30)
2. **Activity** The name of the activity that the measurements correspond to. These can be *WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING* and *LAYING*.

The following columns represent the mean of recorded data points for the given subject and activity. The description of these measurements is given in the *features_info.txt* file contained within the original data set zip file.
